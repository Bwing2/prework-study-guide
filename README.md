# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is the prework study guide for my coding bootcamp. It displays a webpage that covers the topics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 

## Installation

Does not need to be installed.

## Usage

Each section of the Prework Study Guide has notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. Refresh the page to get a random answer on what to study.
